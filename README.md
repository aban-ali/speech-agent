# 🎭 Voices in Your Head

A real-time multi-agent voice AI system where a single spoken input triggers
multiple AI personalities that respond, interrupt, and overlap in audio.

Built to explore **speech-first AI UX**, **multi-agent orchestration**, and
**low-latency voice pipelines** using both **local open-source models** and
**proprietary APIs**.

## ✨ Features

- 🎙️ **Speech-to-Text** (local Whisper / Groq Whisper)
- 🧠 **Multi-agent LLM system**
  - Different personalities
  - Independent reasoning
  - Sequential-safe inference (llama.cpp)
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech**
  - Local TTS (Coqui VITS)
  - Proprietary TTS (Groq / Orpheus)
- 🎧 **Overlapping audio mixing**
  - Agents interrupt naturally
  - Human-like timing offsets
- ⚡ **Streaming-style UX**
  - Audio starts as soon as agents finish
- 🌐 **React frontend**
  - Browser-based audio recording
  - Live transcript & agent cards
- 🐳 **Fully Dockerized**
- 🔁 **Hybrid mode**
  - Switch between local models and Groq APIs

## ▶️ Running the Project

```bash
docker compose up
```

## 🎯 Why This Project

Most voice assistants are single-response systems.
This project explores:
- Voice as a primary interface
- Multiple AI perspectives in real time
- How timing and overlap change perceived intelligence

## 📌 Future Work

True streaming TTS (chunk-level)
Emotion control per agent
Mobile-friendly UI
Agent-to-agent debates
